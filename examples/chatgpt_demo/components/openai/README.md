# **OpenAI Component**

The ESP-OpenAI component currently offers support for two primary features: ChatGPT and Whisper AI.

ChatGPT is a powerful conversational AI model that excels in interactive conversations. It generates natural and coherent responses based on the context of the conversation, making it suitable for various applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer support systems.

Whisper AI, developed by OpenAI, is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. It converts spoken language into written text and finds applications in transcription services, voice assistants, and audio analysis.
